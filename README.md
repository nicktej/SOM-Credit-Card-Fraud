# Credit Card Fraud

This is a Self Organizing Map used to analyze credit card fraud. The AI is trained to predict which people are dishonest credit card users. As part of the mega case study, the SOM combined with the ANN is able to find out the accuracy and also which users are the fraudulent ones. 

## Prerequisites

This project uses Python 3. You will need  Numpy, Matplotlib, and so on. I used Spyder on Anaconda to code this.
